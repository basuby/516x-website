### Purpose

Herbicide distributions require optimization in order to fully utilize the potential of smart sprayers. This page is dedicated to distribution data collection and modeling, and particularly the viability of data stacking of one distribution in order to simulate multiple nozzles on one sprayer boom. The tools below will be left here until the final version in order to help with the page construction

## Materials

This page will utilize a data file that will be linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) later, but for now this will be a placeholder link. Utilizing this data, graphical output will be displayed and discussed below about the observed error between a stacked model and observed data for a three-nozzle setup, with a chosen model scheme of the error that can "correct" this data, as well as the tests.
